If you develop a tool that could be advertised for here, please [contact us](mailto:contact@solidproject.org).

# Solid-specific libraries

## Javascript

Note that several of these will use Solid authentication from solid-auth-client if present.
See also [solid-lib-comparison](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-lib-comparison) for a handy comparison between three commonly used data access libraries.
