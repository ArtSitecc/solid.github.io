At this step of the tutorial, you should have:
- A vocabulary expressed in RDF, potentially in multiple syntaxes (Turtle, JSON-LD, N3, RDF/XML...)
- A documentation for this vocabulary in HTML

If you don't, then you should go back to the [vocabulary building tutorial](/for-developers/apps/vocabularies/create). If you do, let's go live!

The publication will be in two parts:
- Publication of the [RDF and HTML documentation](/for-developers/apps/vocabularies/publish/rdf)
- Publication of the code artifacts (tutorial under construction)
